# :::::::::::::::::::::: DEFINE SOME FUNCTIONS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

dataMunger <- function(baseEventData, StateNames, ForcesTable, SourceString){

    # ::::::::: DESCRIPTION
    #
    # The function performs the following transformations in the data to 
    # produce the desired output data:
    #
    # 1. add actual names of states and municipalities from a Census table;
    #    currently the database only has their numeric codes
    # 2. rename columns from Spanish to English (not everyone speaks both languages)
    # 3. convert UNIX timestamp variable to a time object; this will be useful to 
    #    seamlessly create a date variable, and extract month names for graphing
    # 4. some additional string changes in state abbreviations that will be useful 
    #    when graphing
    # 5. adding a new variable that indicates the armed force involved in the 
    #    confrontation event 
    # 6. replace all missing values with 0; this will come in handy as we start to
    #    explore the data futher
    #
    # ::::: INPUTS
    #
    # i)   BaseEventData - the raw database to be munged
    # ii)  StatesName - a table with State/Municipality names
    # iii) ForcesTable - a table that identifies which armed forces were involved in the event
    # iv)  SourceString  - a string that will identify origin of the table

    # The function munges table that contains the armed forces participating

    # wrangling needs to happen to produce a single row per event and not 
    # losing information, hence that information is placed in additional 
    # columns.
    #
    # 1. add actual names of armed forces from a manually input table gathered from
    #    data documentation
    # 2. converts a variable containing the names of armed forces into columns
