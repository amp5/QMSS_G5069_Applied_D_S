</p>

I organized our files as such:

**1) Background folder**: Zach's NYPD project and any other research we have and want to save goes into this folder:  https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Background

**2) Code folder**:  All current/up-to-date/relevant code is saved here:  https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Code and within this folder, there is a subfolder for all **outdated code** - please move outdated code files from the **Code** folder to this subfolder when appropriate: https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Code/Outdated%20Code

**3) Data/Code Book** folder: The code book is here (https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Data:Code%20Book) as well as 2 subfolders:

  **3a) Cleaned**: All cleaned datasets that we are currently using: https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Data:Code%20Book/Cleaned
  
  **3b) Raw/Outdated**: All datasets that we aren't using anymore are saved here - please move outdated datasets from the **Cleaned** folder to this folder when appropriate: https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Data:Code%20Book/Raw:Outdated

**4) Reports folder**: All of our written assignments are saved here e.g., proposal (one pager).  Going forward, we'll save our final presentation and paper here as well: https://github.com/amp5/QMSS_G5069_Applied_D_S/tree/master/Reports

</p>

First the most up-to-date full and cleaned data set is *'2015_stopandfrisk_CLEAN_w_counties.csv'*
The data set *'2015_stopandfrisk_CLEAN.csv'* actually had rows where there were no x and y coordinates.

The original csv had 22563 rows, after all rows w/ NA in xcoord removed, the new file has 21747 rows.

For a focus on the Bronx area please use *'bronx_pf_unq.csv'*

4 maps have been created:

The problem I'm running into now is merging the csv file with a block level shapefile. 
Until I can figure out how to do so I can't run any spatial regression tests. 

I think the next step should be to work on our models focusing on the Bronx as that has the highest amounts of police force.
Also I think something I need to redo will be the first 3 maps because they were created with the original csv file which had
rows with NA xcoords and ycoords. Thus the sums are slightly off. It should make too much of a difference. But just to be safe.
